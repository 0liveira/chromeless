# Chromeless [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/chromeless.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/chromeless)

Chrome automation made simple. Runs locally or headless on AWS Lambda. (**[See Demo](https://chromeless.netlify.com/)**)

## Chromeless can be used to...

* Run 1000s of **browser integration tests in parallel** ‚ö°Ô∏è
* Crawl the web & automated screenshots
* Write bots that require a real browser
* *Do pretty much everything you've used __PhantomJS, NightmareJS or Selenium__ before*

### Examples

* [prep](https://github.com/graphcool/prep): Compile-time prerendering for SPA/PWA (like React, Vue...) instead of server-side rendering (SSR)
* See the full [examples list](/examples) for more

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try it out

You can try out Chromeless and explore the API in the browser-based **[demo playground](https://chromeless.netlify.com/)**

## How it works

With Chromeless you can control Chrome (open website, click elements, fill out forms...) using an [elegant API](#api). This is useful for integration tests or any other scenario where you'd need to script a real browser.

### There are 2 ways to use Chromeless

1. Running Chrome on your local computer
2. Running Chrome on AWS Lambda and control it remotely

### 1. Local Setup

For local development purposes where a fast feedback loop is necessary, the easiest way to use Chromeless is by controlling your local Chrome browser. Just follow the [usage guide](#usage) to get started.

### 2. Remote Proxy Setup

You can also run Chrome in [headless-mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) on AWS Lambda. This way you can speed up your tests by running them in parallel. (In [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/)'s case this decreased test durations from ~20min to a few seconds.)

Chromeless comes out of the box with a remote proxy built-in - the usage stays completely the same. This way you can write and run your tests locally by they will actually be executed remotely on AWS Lambda. The proxy connects to Lambda through a Websocket connection to forward commands and return the evaluation results.

## Installation
```sh
npm install chromeless
```

### Remote Setup

The project contains a [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) service for running and driving Chrome remotely on AWS Lambda.

1. Deploy The RemoteChrome service to AWS Lambda. More details [here](https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless/tree/master/serverless#setup)
2. Follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/graphcool/chromeless/tree/master/serverless#remotechrome).

```js
const chromeless = new Chromeless({
  remote: {
    endpointUrl: 'https://XXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev'
    apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
  },
})
```

## Usage
```js
const Chromeless = require('chromeless')

async function run() {
  const chromeless = new Chromeless()

  const screenshot = await chromeless
    .goto('https://www.google.com')
    .type('chromeless', 'input[name="q"]')
    .press(13)
    .wait('#resultStats')
    .screenshot()

  console.log(screenshot) // prints local file path or S3 url

  await chromeless.end()
}

run().catch(console.error.bind(console))
```

### Local chrome usage

```sh
alias canary="/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary"
canary --remote-debugging-port=9222 --disable-gpu http://localhost:9222
canary --remote-debugging-port=9222 --disable-gpu http://localhost:9222 --headless
```

### API

*TODO*

## FAQ

### How is this different from [NightmareJS](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare), PhantomJS or Selenium?

### I'm new to AWS Lambda, is this still for me?

### How much does it cost to run Chromeless in production?

### Are there any limitations?

If you're running Chromeless on AWS Lambda, the execution cannot take longer than 5 minutes which is the current limit of Lambda. Besides that, every feature that's supported in Chrome is also working with Chromeless.
